# AGI Project Structure

This project is designed to build an AGI system with the following components:

- Conversational AI using GPT-2 and FLAN
- Custom local memory for user information
- Personality systems for adaptive responses
- MCP protocol integration for internet-based learning

## Folders
- `agents/` - AI agent implementations
- `personality/` - Personality and emotional state modules
- `memory/` - Local memory system for user data
- `mcp_integration/` - MCP protocol and internet learning modules
- `env_setup/` - Environment setup scripts and requirements

## Getting Started
1. Set up the Python environment and install dependencies (see `env_setup/`)
2. Implement initial agents in `agents/`
3. Add personality and memory systems
4. Integrate MCP protocol for internet-based learning
